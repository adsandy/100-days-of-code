### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the contact section of my site for FreeCodeCamp's portfolio project.  This included adding and formatting Bootstrap buttons, and working with Bootstrap's grid system.  I also started adding content to the portfolio section of the site, including a description and two images of a past project.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap grid doesn't always do what you think, but really isn't too bad.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added another project with images to the portfolio.  Main work was in fixing an incorrectly displaying navigation bar with Bootstrap.  I found resources online to help with this issue, and I was able to make the navbar collapse when viewing on mobile.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap navbars should by default be collapsed on mobile.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the portfolio project, including the about section.  Added JS scrolling to the navbar.  Started work on the Javascript section of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** There should be a bootstrap js class for the smooth scrolling.  It seems like a feature most people would want by default.
