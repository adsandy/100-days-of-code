### Day 1: January 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the contact section of my site for FreeCodeCamp's portfolio project.  This included adding and formatting Bootstrap buttons, and working with Bootstrap's grid system.  I also started adding content to the portfolio section of the site, including a description and two images of a past project.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap grid doesn't always do what you think, but really isn't too bad.

### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Added another project with images to the portfolio.  Main work was in fixing an incorrectly displaying navigation bar with Bootstrap.  I found resources online to help with this issue, and I was able to make the navbar collapse when viewing on mobile.

**Thoughts:** Bootstrap navbars should by default be collapsed on mobile.

### Day 3: January 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the portfolio project, including the about section.  Added JS scrolling to the navbar.  Started work on the Javascript section of Free Code Camp.

**Thoughts:** There should be a bootstrap js class for the smooth scrolling.  It seems like a feature most people would want by default.

### Day 4: January 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked hard on the Free Code Camp basic JS exercises.  I hope to be done with this section by the end of the day tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** JS is evil.

### Day 5: January 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Free Code Camp basic JS exercises and the OOP exercises.

**Thoughts:** Looking forward to starting the basic algorithm scripting problems tomorrow.

**Link to work:** NA, see freecodecamp.com


### Day 6: January 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed about half of the Free Code Camp basic algorithm scripting challenges.

**Link to work:** NA, see freecodecamp.com

### Day 7: January 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the second hald of the Free Code Camp basic algorithm scripting challenges.  Tomorrow I start the API training.

**Thoughts:** It helps to use a language every day.

**Link to work:** NA, see freecodecamp.com

### Day 8: January 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished Free Code Camp API exercises, and completed the random quote project.

**Thoughts:** JQuery is so much more user friendly and easy to learn than JS.

### Day 9: January 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed the local weather app.

**Thoughts:** APIs aren't terribly hard to use when the documentation is clear.

### Day 10: January 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the Wikipedia viewer.

**Thoughts:** Wikipedia API isn't too bad.

### Day 11: January 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made progress on the Wikipedia viewer.  The search API is functional, but I still need to work out displaying the results in a nice way and clearing old results when a new query is entered.

**Thoughts:** It seems like each API has a particular "trick" to making it work.  Wikipedia requires the inclusion of 'origin=\*' in the query to return results.

### Day 12: January 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Wikipedia viewer!

**Thoughts:**  The Twitch challenge looks intimidating.  I actually have no idea what Twitch is.

### Day 13: January 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started work on the Twitch.tv status viewer.  Got the api working, but need to put in some work with making the table look nice and getting info about the stream

**Thoughts**: Still no idea what Twitch is actually for.  Whenever I go on their site the streams always take forever to load.
